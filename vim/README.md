One step vim IDE!
-----------------

`install.sh` will grab `vim-pathogen` and install it, along with some useful plugins. `update.sh` will update `vim-pathogen`, and any installed plugins from a remote git repo. If you want more settings than what `vim-sensible` provides, have a look at `vimrc.custom`, or just overwrite `vimrc` with it.
